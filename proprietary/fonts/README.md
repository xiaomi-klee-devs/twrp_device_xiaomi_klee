# Recovery CJK fonts

`MiSans.ttf` is a recovery-sized subset of the locally supplied
`orangefox_klee/MiSans/otf/MiSans-Regular.otf`. OrangeFox uses this single font
both as its selectable MiSans theme family and as the fallback for glyphs
missing from the selected Latin font. The subset combines the previous
recovery CJK coverage with every character supported by MiSans and referenced
by the built-in OrangeFox XML resources.
